Homework with the analysis of old and new ratings of top 250 'Kinopoisk' movies.

I checked the following hypothesis using Mann-Whitney U-test and Boostrap:

H0 - there is no statistical difference between rating_new and rating_old

Ha - the difference between rating_new and rating_old exists

Then compared the ratings of all the films ranked, then ratings of movies of a similar genre/decade of creating/country of origin and make the conclusions.
